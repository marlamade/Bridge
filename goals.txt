To investigate 10-12 mini notrump
- Create lots of deals in which North has 10-12 balanced (no more than 27ish combined?)
- Bid each one using some set of rules
- Double Dummy play
- Scoring

Other Functionality
- Print hands from dealer to file
- Read hands from file
- Read a file specifying the type of deal desired (perhaps as simple as a 
  file with a function called check_validity that takes in a deal and 
  returns 1 or 0. I.E, instead of having a function that reads and checks a 
  spec sheet, we just write the function each time)
